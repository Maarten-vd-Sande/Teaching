It is easiest to install the dependencies with [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). Once conda is installed install the environment with:
```
conda env create -f env.yaml 
```
Then activate it:
```
conda activate dimension_reduction
```
And now you are ready to run the python files.
```
python [file]
```
